### History
While building user interfaces and apps around logistic processes, ERP systems etc. 
Most of the users came from the world of spreadsheets and flatfiles. Existing ERP systems, legacy interfaces with lot of dials requires training and quite some overhead.
With that in mind we started the journey of savagerow, inspired by airtable and other lowcode/nocode platforms.
Lot of installation in warehouses, industrial infrastructure are airgapped, therefore you can deploy the platform on-premise.

We see the usage of this platform beyond ERP systems, logistic process etc. As the product reached minimum viable product status, therefore we decided to opensource it.
